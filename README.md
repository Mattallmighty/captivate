Captivate is capable of running autonomously, but it's designed so you can take as much control as you'd like. In addition to all that power, setup has never been easier. This same setup can be configured in minutes with Captivate. If I change the tempo, or the song, captivate adjusts accordingly. Captivate's design was inspired by synthesisers, so you'll find familiar tools like LFO's, midi integration, pads, and randomizers.
